> __‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Purpose Only__: This tool is intended for educational and learning purposes. Please consider supporting the Proxmox team by purchasing a [subscription](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/pricing) for production environments.

A robust solution to permanently disable the Proxmox VE subscription nag screen using a dpkg trigger package that automatically re-applies the patch whenever `proxmox-widget-toolkit` is upgraded.

## üöÄ Features

- __Permanent Fix__: Creates a dpkg trigger package that automatically re-applies the nag removal patch
- __Upgrade-Safe__: Automatically triggers when `proxmox-widget-toolkit` is updated
- __Clean Uninstall__: Easily remove the package and restore original vendor files
- __Self-Testing__: Includes verification to ensure the patch is working correctly
- __No Manual Intervention__: Set it once and forget it

## üìã Requirements

- Proxmox VE server
- Root access
- `proxmox-widget-toolkit` package installed

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Quick Install (One-liner)

For a quick installation, you can use one of these one-liner commands:

__Using wget:__

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fox-oss/Proxmox-Nag-Disabler/main/nag.sh | bash
```

__Using curl:__

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fox-oss/Proxmox-Nag-Disabler/main/nag.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fox-oss/Proxmox-Nag-Disabler.git
   cd Proxmox-Nag-Disabler
   ```

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x nag.sh
   ```

3. Run the installer with root privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo ./nag.sh
   ```

The script will:

- Build a dpkg trigger package
- Install the package
- Apply the nag removal patch
- Restart the pveproxy service
- Verify the installation

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

To remove the package and restore the original Proxmox files:

```bash
sudo ./nag.sh --uninstall
```

## üîß How It Works

1. __Package Creation__: The script creates a dpkg trigger package that monitors changes to Proxmox JavaScript files
2. __Trigger Activation__: When `proxmox-widget-toolkit` is upgraded, the trigger automatically fires
3. __Patch Application__: The embedded patcher script removes the subscription nag screen code
4. __Service Restart__: The pveproxy service is restarted to apply changes

## üìÅ Generated Files

The package creates the following files on your system:

- `/usr/local/bin/pve-nonag-patch.sh` - The patcher script
- Package triggers for JavaScript files in `/usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit/`
